# Baldi Arcade Mod
This mod adds an endless amount of floors to Baldi's Basics Plus!
# Prerequisites
- [BepInEx core DLLs](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.21)
- [MTM101BaldAPI 2.0](https://gamebanana.com/mods/383711)
- Visual Studio
Put the BepInEx core DLLs and the MTM101BaldAPI dll into a folder named "Dependencies", it's likely it doesn't already exist so you need to create it.
Load up the solution in Visual Studio and you should be able to build.
